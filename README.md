# Computational-Drug-Discovery

In Part 1, we will be performing Data Collection and Pre-Processing from the ChEMBL Database.

In Part 2, we will be performing Descriptor Calculation and Exploratory Data Analysis.

In Part 3, we will be calculating molecular descriptors that are essentially quantitative description of the compounds in the dataset. 

In Part 4, we will be building a regression model of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors using the random forest algorithm.

In Part 5, we will be comparing several ML algorithms for build regression models of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
